## What is a DNA strand?

A DNA strand consists of either of the four bases found in a DNA molecule, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).

## Problem statement:

Given a DNA string, find the matching corpus.

## Input/ Output format:

```
"input.txt" contains the DNA strands on which trie is to be formed/ Algorithms are to be tested.
"testCase.txt" contains the test query which has to be to matched
"corpus.txt" contains output of TRIE implementation1
"rabinOutput.txt" contains output of RABIN KARP implementation
"kmpOutput.txt" contains output of KMP implementation
```
